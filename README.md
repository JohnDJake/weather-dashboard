# Weather Dashboard (Homework-06)

## Description

This is a dashboard to display weather data including the current weather and 5-day forecast for any location, written in HTML and JavaScript. It uses APIs to get location and weather data. The search history and last searched location are stored locally, and will be displayed when the page is loaded.

[Deployed here on Github Pages](https://johndjake.github.io/weather-dashboard/).


## Usage

Enter a location in the search field to see the weather at that location. Click on any of the locations in the search history below the searchbar to see the weather at that location. If you don't get the location you expect, try being more specific (eg. City, State instead of just City). Try any location, even a specific address!
